Profiles
========

Profiles are used to configure your application for different environments.
   
The Apigee 127 cli will automatically choose a profile matching the name of the account you deploy with if you include
one in this directory. If you do not, default.json will be chosen. This is also used by default when starting the
project locally.

However, you may override this behavior and select a specific profile via the a127 CLI.
